<p>Below is an&nbsp;example of what we do, helping you focus on smarter commerce.</p>
<h3>Customer Service</h3>
<p>We all know customer service is very important, but it is the most important aspect in keeping quality customers. Some will think cost is the most important quality of retaining customers, it’s not, because someone will come through with a lower price. Those people will go with the lower cost, so what you want is quality customers whom you have built loyalty with and rapport. Through great cuastomer service you will gain customer retention even if your prices are just a little bit higher than your competitor.</p>
<h3>Upselling</h3>
<p><b>Upselling</b>&nbsp;(sometimes “<b>up-selling</b>“) is a&nbsp;sales technique&nbsp;whereby a seller induces the&nbsp;customer&nbsp;to purchase more expensive items, upgrades, or other add-ons in an attempt to make a more profitable sale. Upselling usually involves marketing more profitable&nbsp;services&nbsp;or&nbsp;products&nbsp;but can also be simply exposing the customer to other options that were perhaps not considered previously. Upselling implies selling something that is more profitable or otherwise preferable for the seller instead of, or in addition to,&nbsp;the original sale. A different technique is&nbsp;cross-selling&nbsp;in which a seller tries to sell something else. In practice, large businesses usually combine upselling and&nbsp;cross-selling&nbsp;techniques to enhance the value that the client or clients get from the organization in addition to maximizing the profit that the business gets from the client. In doing so, the organization must ensure that the relationship with the client is not disrupted. In a restaurant and other similar settings, upselling is commonplace and an accepted form of business. In other businesses, such as car sales, the customer’s perception of the attempted upsell can be viewed negatively and thereby affect the desired result.</p>
<h3>Cross Selling</h3>
<p><b>Cross-selling</b>&nbsp;is the action or practice of selling among or between clients, markets, traders, etc. or the action or practice of selling an additional product or service to an existing customer. This article deals exclusively with the latter meaning. In practice, businesses define cross-selling in many different ways. Elements that might influence the definition might include the size of the business, the industry sector it operates within and the financial motivations of those required to define the term.&nbsp;The objectives of cross-selling can be either to increase the income derived from the client or clients or to protect the relationship with the client or clients. The approach to the process of cross-selling can be varied.</p>
<p>Unlike the acquiring of new business, cross-selling involves an element of risk that existing relationships with the client could be disrupted. For that reason, it is important to ensure that the additional product or service being sold to the client or clients enhances the value the client or clients get from the organization.</p>
<p>In practice, large businesses usually combine cross-selling and&nbsp;up-selling&nbsp;techniques to enhance the value that the client or clients gets from the organization (and vice versa).</p>
<h3>Overcoming Objections</h3>
<p>Selling doesn’t come naturally to many small business owners, but that doesn’t mean they can’t do it effectively. Often the key is understanding what is stopping your potential client from making a decision in your favor. Once you know why he or she is hesitating, you can reply directly to that specific objection. We teach you how to identify these objection and get passed them.</p>
