<h3>Your Website</h3>
<p>We've been helping businesses become successful since 2010 by getting their presence known online through visually appealing, semantically coded, search engine optimized websites. Since then Google has become an ever-changing monster and we've learned how to adapt.</p>
<p>Since April 21<sup>st</sup>, 2015 Google changed it's algorithm to add a focus on user experience on mobile devices. According to Pew research center, they looked at Internet availability across the US. They found out that 15 percent of the population have limited options for Internet access other than their phones while 10 percent don't have other connection apart from their data plans. Believe it or not, not everyone has broadband access at home. It makes more sense to get a mobile data plan for some because they are always out of the house anyway.</p>
<p>Sixty-four (64%) percent of all American adults now own and use smartphones. That's huge increase from the 35% back in 2011. Looking at the age groups, younger adults ages 18 to 29 rely on their phones for online access. Those in the low-income household level, at least some 13 percent, are also dependent on their smartphones. Only 1 percent of people earning $75,000 and above rely on their mobile devices for Internet. Looking at the racial groups, four percent of whites, 13 percent of Latinos, and 12 percent of African Americans depend on their phones for Internet access.</p>
<p>With that said, it is practically a requirement to have a mobile optimized website if you want to rank on Google for search results on mobile. Many other agencies are either not providing mobile optimization or charging clients an arm and a leg for mobile optimization. We build for mobile first, we make sure all of our clients' web assets have a great user-experience across all devices so there are no penalizations.</p>
