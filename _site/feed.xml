        <description>&lt;p&gt;Blog Post&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. If you have questions, you can ask them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The importance of Brand for SEO</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012&quot; src=&quot;/_img/05-10-15.png&quot; alt=&quot;05-10-15&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may or may not hear about it all of the time but brand is becoming and important aspect of SEO as it relates to Google search engine results. Rand Fishkin, of Moz, had a really great Whiteboard Friday recently on &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/blog/is-brand-a-google-ranking-factor-whiteboard-friday&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Is Brand a Google Ranking Factor&lt;/a&gt;. During his most recent (as of the publication of this post) &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/blog/google-may-use-your-behavior-to-impact-search-rankings-whiteboard-friday&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Whiteboard Friday&lt;/a&gt;, he kind of mentions it in a round about way as well but it gives insight to the future of the importance of brand for SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Brand?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to press forward I believe it&#39;s important we are on the same page when I say &quot;brand&quot; as there are many definitions. The brand I&#39;m referring to is the perception customers have about a product or service. Meaning when you think of a product or service you think of a brand name, and not what the product or service actually is. For example, many people say Kleenex instead of tissue, or Q-Tip instead of cotton swab. Why? These are brands everyone is familiar with. One more example, and this is depending on what part of the country you&#39;re in, you or some one you know might ask for a coke instead of asking for a pop or soda. Coke is short for Coke-a-Cola. So when thinking about brand I&#39;m talking about perception customers have about a product or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why is brand important for SEO?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We as SEO&#39;s are starting to see more of a trend, when people are searching, that certain brands pop up around some search queries. For example, if you Google &quot;best food in houston&quot;, you&#39;ll see some very familiar sites there. Yelp, Trip Advisor, and others will all be on that page. That&#39;s because Google knows many people use those sites as resources and answers to their search queries. These sites have very strong ranking signals for this query even though none of those words in the query were keywords those sites were trying to rank on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building your brand in your industry is invaluable because when someone needs your product or service you want them to think of your brand name not the generic term for it. When you have more and more people searching for something in your industry and you&#39;re promoting your content and site and building your audience, people&#39;s search queries start evolving. We&#39;ll use our company as an example, as we start to grow and push ourselves to be industry leader, more people will go from searching &quot;digital marketing houston&quot; to versatech digital marketing&quot;. When more queries start including your brand name in the query Google recognizes that and starts saying, a lot of people looking for &quot;digital marketing houston&quot; are also searching &quot;versatech digital marketing&quot; and ending their search there, they must be relevant let&#39;s boost their ranking signals as they seem to be a solution for our searchers who&#39;s search queries are similar to &quot;digital marketing houston&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every business owner&#39;s goal is to build a brand. Most get side tracked and focus on running the business instead of getting the same associated with the product or service being offered. Getting the brand name associated with the product or service is paramount not only from an SEO perspective, but from an overall business perspective. Get your brand associated with a product or service and you have a giant piece of the success pie.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Moz&#39;s Issues With Mozscape Wreaks Havoc On SEO</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re a Moz user like we are here at VersaTech Marketing, you&#39;ve probably noticed some major fluctuations in external links. Not little fluctuations... Huge fluctuations. Through one of our sets of data we saw Dell go from 5.2 million external links to 1.8 million external links over the course about 2 months. That&#39;s a 65% drop in external links. That&#39;s an enormous drop off no matter how you look at it. Why is this significant you ask? Lets dive into some details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.versatechmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Moz-Analytics.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003&quot; src=&quot;/_img/Moz-Analytics.png&quot; alt=&quot;Moz-Analytics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decreased Domain Authority&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major significance of the MozScape issue is domain authority is decreasing. Not that Google directly uses domain authority to rank your site, but it&#39;s a great comparison tool to see the strength of your domain versus competitors. With domain authority not working properly, for what seems to be two months now, it&#39;s causing SEO&#39;s a bit of turmoil for their reports. As a digital marketing solutions provider, with SEO being one of our solutions, we&#39;re having to explain to our clients why their data is going in the opposite direction of where we had them. This is not a good look for Moz. Rand Fishkin, one of the founders of Moz, was transparent about the issues &lt;a href=&quot;http://moz.com/community/q/what-s-the-story-on-mozscape-updates&quot;&gt;in a post when the issues we being reported at the end of April beginning of May&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Upset Clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our SEO clients, depending on which plan you&#39;re on, you get a weekly or monthly SEO report. Our clients see the results of the faulty Mozscape and it really makes us look bad. That&#39;s any SEO organization using Moz&#39;s tools. We&#39;ve looked into other tools to try and show better metrics, and we use Google Analytics to support our clients growth, but since Moz is the creator of Domain Authority it really makes it difficult. Thus far our clients understand what&#39;s going on because we have explained it to them in a way they can understand, but they were pretty upset when they received their auto generated report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We Believe in Rand!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rand Fishkin is one of my personal idols in the SEO world, and I know innovation has its road block and speed bumps. So I personally do not fault Moz on this error. As a web developer and a person who live his life in a pool of code I know finding a bug in a vast ocean of code can be one of the most challenging parts of being a developer or code engineer. I hope for their sake, they find the issue quick and get it resolved because many SEO companies like us rely on the data their tools output.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Importance of a Responsive Web Design</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In todays technology driven world we find ourselves using our mobile devices rather than using our laptops or desktop computers. We&#39;re all driven by that convenience factor, power in the palms of our hands. This is now being reflected by the all powerful Google. Mobile web design, or responsive web design, is no longer just a design fad anymore, it&#39;s a necessity if you wish to rank in mobile search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What&#39;s all the hype about?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 2007, maybe a little bit longer, people started coming to the conclusion that mobile devices were going to shape the landscape of web design and development. We as an industry saw this around the time the original iPhones were starting come out and sweep the world. Internet and email at your finger tips. People were starting to use their phone as a way of finding local businesses on the go. Since then technologies and data speeds have increased so much, a lot of people are moving away from having home based internet and using their mobile devices as their primary source for their internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to studies from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nielsen.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marketingland.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marketing Land&lt;/a&gt;, and our own independent study, 95% of mobile users use their devices for mobile search. 52% of all local searches are done from a mobile device. Finally 9 out of 10 mobile searches result in a purchase or visit. This is what all of the hype is about. 90% of mobile searches result in a purchase or visit, that&#39;s a high conversion rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-940&quot; src=&quot;/_img/Mobile-Search-Infographic.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mobile Search Infographic&quot; width=&quot;95%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Okay, but I&#39;m still not convinced I need a &quot;Mobile-Friendly&quot; website.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t &quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; a mobile-friendly website but here&#39;s more information to think about. Google has now started separating their mobile search results from their desktop search results. Meaning you could search for one thing at your house or office, get in your car and have a lapse of memory, search for the same thing on your phone and get completely different results.. These different results are due to these sites having a better user experience on mobile. As stated above 90% of mobile searches result in a purchase or visit. When people have a good first impression, a good first experience, they&#39;re more likely to make the first visit and become a repeat customer. So you don&#39;t need a mobile friendly site, but if you want to rank better for local results when people are shopping for your goods or services, then it would be in your best interest to have a mobile-friendly site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ok, I&#39;m swayed, but I&#39;ve heard of responsive and a mobile site. What&#39;s the difference?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a common notion that the two are one in the same. This is false and I want to clarify this right now so there are no misconceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Responsive Web Design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsive web design is the are of web design where no matter what device, screen size, screen resolution, the site will always render a certain way. The look and feel will remain consistant because it&#39;s the same exact files being displayed, the content it just being shifted and moved to accomodate the size of the view port. If your site is not responsive, it&#39;s a good Idea to have it rebuilt to be responsive. It may cost more up front, but it will save you thousands in the long run. Did I mention that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krymsonproductions.com/services/houston-web-design/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we build websites&lt;/a&gt; with a mobile first mentality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mobile Website&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mobile website is usually a different set of code that is called by a piece of javascript based on the header output of the mobile browser. You commonly see mobile sites with a sub-domain of &quot;m&quot; (http://m.example.com). This commonly does not resize to fit any view port and can be a different experience from device to device. Content has to be duplicated from the main site and can cause duplicate content penalizations. Building a mobile website may seem more cost effective up front if you don;t want to rebuild your site. The problem with that is, because content is duplicated, any updates require double the work, so maintenance in the long run will cost you potentially thousands more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Let&#39;s recap what we&#39;ve just went over.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsive web design is the are of building a website for any viewport size and device. Mobile-friendly websites will rank higher in Google mobile search results. 90% of mobile searches end up with a purchase or visit. Choose responsive web design over a mobile web site, it will save you more money and you&#39;re going to have a consistant experience across all browsers and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
