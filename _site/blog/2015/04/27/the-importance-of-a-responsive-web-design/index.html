  <article class="post-content">
    <p>In todays technology driven world we find ourselves using our mobile devices rather than using our laptops or desktop computers. We're all driven by that convenience factor, power in the palms of our hands. This is now being reflected by the all powerful Google. Mobile web design, or responsive web design, is no longer just a design fad anymore, it's a necessity if you wish to rank in mobile search results.</p>
<h4>What's all the hype about?</h4>
<p>Around 2007, maybe a little bit longer, people started coming to the conclusion that mobile devices were going to shape the landscape of web design and development. We as an industry saw this around the time the original iPhones were starting come out and sweep the world. Internet and email at your finger tips. People were starting to use their phone as a way of finding local businesses on the go. Since then technologies and data speeds have increased so much, a lot of people are moving away from having home based internet and using their mobile devices as their primary source for their internet.</p>
<p>According to studies from <a href="http://www.nielsen.com" target="_blank">Nielsen</a>, <a href="http://www.marketingland.com" target="_blank">Marketing Land</a>, and our own independent study, 95% of mobile users use their devices for mobile search. 52% of all local searches are done from a mobile device. Finally 9 out of 10 mobile searches result in a purchase or visit. This is what all of the hype is about. 90% of mobile searches result in a purchase or visit, that's a high conversion rate.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940" src="/_img/Mobile-Search-Infographic.png" alt="Mobile Search Infographic" width="95%" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Okay, but I'm still not convinced I need a "Mobile-Friendly" website.</h4>
<p>You don't "<em><strong>NEED</strong></em>" a mobile-friendly website but here's more information to think about. Google has now started separating their mobile search results from their desktop search results. Meaning you could search for one thing at your house or office, get in your car and have a lapse of memory, search for the same thing on your phone and get completely different results.. These different results are due to these sites having a better user experience on mobile. As stated above 90% of mobile searches result in a purchase or visit. When people have a good first impression, a good first experience, they're more likely to make the first visit and become a repeat customer. So you don't need a mobile friendly site, but if you want to rank better for local results when people are shopping for your goods or services, then it would be in your best interest to have a mobile-friendly site.</p>
<h4>Ok, I'm swayed, but I've heard of responsive and a mobile site. What's the difference?</h4>
<p>There is a common notion that the two are one in the same. This is false and I want to clarify this right now so there are no misconceptions.</p>
<h4>Responsive Web Design</h4>
<p>Responsive web design is the are of web design where no matter what device, screen size, screen resolution, the site will always render a certain way. The look and feel will remain consistant because it's the same exact files being displayed, the content it just being shifted and moved to accomodate the size of the view port. If your site is not responsive, it's a good Idea to have it rebuilt to be responsive. It may cost more up front, but it will save you thousands in the long run. Did I mention that <a href="http://www.krymsonproductions.com/services/houston-web-design/" target="_blank">we build websites</a> with a mobile first mentality?</p>
<h4>Mobile Website</h4>
<p>A mobile website is usually a different set of code that is called by a piece of javascript based on the header output of the mobile browser. You commonly see mobile sites with a sub-domain of "m" (http://m.example.com). This commonly does not resize to fit any view port and can be a different experience from device to device. Content has to be duplicated from the main site and can cause duplicate content penalizations. Building a mobile website may seem more cost effective up front if you don;t want to rebuild your site. The problem with that is, because content is duplicated, any updates require double the work, so maintenance in the long run will cost you potentially thousands more.</p>
<h4>Let's recap what we've just went over.</h4>
<p>Responsive web design is the are of building a website for any viewport size and device. Mobile-friendly websites will rank higher in Google mobile search results. 90% of mobile searches end up with a purchase or visit. Choose responsive web design over a mobile web site, it will save you more money and you're going to have a consistant experience across all browsers and platforms.</p>
