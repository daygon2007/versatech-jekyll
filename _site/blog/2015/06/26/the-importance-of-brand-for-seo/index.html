<p>You may or may not hear about it all of the time but brand is becoming and important aspect of SEO as it relates to Google search engine results. Rand Fishkin, of Moz, had a really great Whiteboard Friday recently on <a href="https://moz.com/blog/is-brand-a-google-ranking-factor-whiteboard-friday" target="blank">Is Brand a Google Ranking Factor</a>. During his most recent (as of the publication of this post) <a href="https://moz.com/blog/google-may-use-your-behavior-to-impact-search-rankings-whiteboard-friday" target="_blank">Whiteboard Friday</a>, he kind of mentions it in a round about way as well but it gives insight to the future of the importance of brand for SEO.</p>
<h3>What is Brand?</h3>
<p>In order to press forward I believe it's important we are on the same page when I say "brand" as there are many definitions. The brand I'm referring to is the perception customers have about a product or service. Meaning when you think of a product or service you think of a brand name, and not what the product or service actually is. For example, many people say Kleenex instead of tissue, or Q-Tip instead of cotton swab. Why? These are brands everyone is familiar with. One more example, and this is depending on what part of the country you're in, you or some one you know might ask for a coke instead of asking for a pop or soda. Coke is short for Coke-a-Cola. So when thinking about brand I'm talking about perception customers have about a product or service.</p>
<h3>Why is brand important for SEO?</h3>
<p>We as SEO's are starting to see more of a trend, when people are searching, that certain brands pop up around some search queries. For example, if you Google "best food in houston", you'll see some very familiar sites there. Yelp, Trip Advisor, and others will all be on that page. That's because Google knows many people use those sites as resources and answers to their search queries. These sites have very strong ranking signals for this query even though none of those words in the query were keywords those sites were trying to rank on.</p>
<p>Building your brand in your industry is invaluable because when someone needs your product or service you want them to think of your brand name not the generic term for it. When you have more and more people searching for something in your industry and you're promoting your content and site and building your audience, people's search queries start evolving. We'll use our company as an example, as we start to grow and push ourselves to be industry leader, more people will go from searching "digital marketing houston" to versatech digital marketing". When more queries start including your brand name in the query Google recognizes that and starts saying, a lot of people looking for "digital marketing houston" are also searching "versatech digital marketing" and ending their search there, they must be relevant let's boost their ranking signals as they seem to be a solution for our searchers who's search queries are similar to "digital marketing houston".</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Every business owner's goal is to build a brand. Most get side tracked and focus on running the business instead of getting the same associated with the product or service being offered. Getting the brand name associated with the product or service is paramount not only from an SEO perspective, but from an overall business perspective. Get your brand associated with a product or service and you have a giant piece of the success pie.</p>
