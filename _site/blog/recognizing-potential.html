<p>Everyone is looking for potential. I say that in a broad term right now but I will break it down in to section a little later on. How can we define potential? The dictionary describes the word potential as "capable of being or becoming", and in the work place every business owner is looking for this in someone or something. I want to discuss this today in this article.</p>
<p>If you are a business owner then I know you have sat down and asked yourself "What is going to make my business run smoother?" or "Is there an easy way to manage financials without spending hundreds of laborious hours combing through receipts and mountains of data?". Then we turn to a little bit of research and find well to manage my expenses I can use Quicken® or Quickbooks® to help me manage all of my financials and payroll. Wow it also keeps track of all my spending and connects with my bank account to tell me what my business is spending money on, how much money I'm making, and it even makes life a easier when taxes come around. When you were doing your research you recognized the potential of one piece of software that will shave off HUNDREDS of man hours and may even reduce your expenses on a CPA and even tell you what you're spending too much money on.</p>
<p>When looking to hire new employees you are looking for potential. You ask yourself, "Is this person going to have the potential to grow with and help grow my business?". You will find this out in the interview you have with them. Now you know (or at least you should know) that people will B.S. you and lie to you to make themselves sound good to get the job. You have to focus your questions abut them so you get to know them... not their skills. If they have a degree in architecture you know they have the skills to design a building but are they passionate about it or are they doing it just because there is good money in it? So my first question that I ask new potential employees is, "When you wake up in the morning and you know you have to go to work, what is you first thought or reaction?" Listen to their answer, look at their facial expressions, look at the way they move their eyes, there is your actual answer. I know for my business here at Krymson Productions I want someone who wakes up in the morning bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and says "Hey, I'm living my dream, I get paid to express my creative ideas, have someone listen and give me recognition, and I get to help people in the process." Contrary to popular belief, money does not make a person happy, doing what you love everyday makes people happy. To wrap up this part of the topic, because I can go on all day about this, you have to look for those people who are going to have the potential to grow with and help grow your company. Someone you know that will be there 10 years down the line and you can trust that when you're not there, they are doing the right thing.</p>
<p>If you're a retailer you always on the lookout for that next product that's going to change your business. For example, you sell computer parts, you don't build computers just sell the parts. You have a good amount of customers but you always hear the question "Do you know someone who can fix computers? My motherboard went out and I'm not sure how to fix it." Sure you know how to instal a motherboard but why not charge $50 bucks and do it for that customer. You get that question 20 times a week, but you've been referring people to a bigger name company. It clicks, how much money have I been giving someone else for something that I can offer too. Now you recognize the potential in expanding your retail business into a service business as well. You hire a person or two to assist in computer repair work and in a bout a year you have potentially doubled your businesses revenues because not only are they buying the replacement parts from you but they are also paying for you to replace that part as well.</p>
<p>A big part of being a business owner is recognizing potential. I hope this article has opened your eyes to broaden your horizons and recognize the potential around you. Asking the right questions to people, asking yourself the right questions. This has helped me grow my businesses I hope it can help grow yours.</p>
