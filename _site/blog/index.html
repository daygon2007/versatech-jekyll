<p>You’ll find this post in your <code>_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code>jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code>_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code>YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Tom&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll docs</a> for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll’s GitHub repo</a>. If you have questions, you can ask them on <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help">Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository</a>.</p>

	The importance of Brand for SEO

<p>You may or may not hear about it all of the time but brand is becoming and important aspect of SEO as it relates to Google search engine results. Rand Fishkin, of Moz, had a really great Whiteboard Friday recently on <a href="https://moz.com/blog/is-brand-a-google-ranking-factor-whiteboard-friday" target="blank">Is Brand a Google Ranking Factor</a>. During his most recent (as of the publication of this post) <a href="https://moz.com/blog/google-may-use-your-behavior-to-impact-search-rankings-whiteboard-friday" target="_blank">Whiteboard Friday</a>, he kind of mentions it in a round about way as well but it gives insight to the future of the importance of brand for SEO.</p>
<h3>What is Brand?</h3>
<p>In order to press forward I believe it's important we are on the same page when I say "brand" as there are many definitions. The brand I'm referring to is the perception customers have about a product or service. Meaning when you think of a product or service you think of a brand name, and not what the product or service actually is. For example, many people say Kleenex instead of tissue, or Q-Tip instead of cotton swab. Why? These are brands everyone is familiar with. One more example, and this is depending on what part of the country you're in, you or some one you know might ask for a coke instead of asking for a pop or soda. Coke is short for Coke-a-Cola. So when thinking about brand I'm talking about perception customers have about a product or service.</p>
<h3>Why is brand important for SEO?</h3>
<p>We as SEO's are starting to see more of a trend, when people are searching, that certain brands pop up around some search queries. For example, if you Google "best food in houston", you'll see some very familiar sites there. Yelp, Trip Advisor, and others will all be on that page. That's because Google knows many people use those sites as resources and answers to their search queries. These sites have very strong ranking signals for this query even though none of those words in the query were keywords those sites were trying to rank on.</p>
<p>Building your brand in your industry is invaluable because when someone needs your product or service you want them to think of your brand name not the generic term for it. When you have more and more people searching for something in your industry and you're promoting your content and site and building your audience, people's search queries start evolving. We'll use our company as an example, as we start to grow and push ourselves to be industry leader, more people will go from searching "digital marketing houston" to versatech digital marketing". When more queries start including your brand name in the query Google recognizes that and starts saying, a lot of people looking for "digital marketing houston" are also searching "versatech digital marketing" and ending their search there, they must be relevant let's boost their ranking signals as they seem to be a solution for our searchers who's search queries are similar to "digital marketing houston".</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Every business owner's goal is to build a brand. Most get side tracked and focus on running the business instead of getting the same associated with the product or service being offered. Getting the brand name associated with the product or service is paramount not only from an SEO perspective, but from an overall business perspective. Get your brand associated with a product or service and you have a giant piece of the success pie.</p>

	Moz's Issues With Mozscape Wreaks Havoc On SEO

        <div class="blog-content"><p>If you're a Moz user like we are here at VersaTech Marketing, you've probably noticed some major fluctuations in external links. Not little fluctuations... Huge fluctuations. Through one of our sets of data we saw Dell go from 5.2 million external links to 1.8 million external links over the course about 2 months. That's a 65% drop in external links. That's an enormous drop off no matter how you look at it. Why is this significant you ask? Lets dive into some details.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.versatechmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Moz-Analytics.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003" src="/_img/Moz-Analytics.png" alt="Moz-Analytics" /></a></p>
<h2>Decreased Domain Authority</h2>
<p>One major significance of the MozScape issue is domain authority is decreasing. Not that Google directly uses domain authority to rank your site, but it's a great comparison tool to see the strength of your domain versus competitors. With domain authority not working properly, for what seems to be two months now, it's causing SEO's a bit of turmoil for their reports. As a digital marketing solutions provider, with SEO being one of our solutions, we're having to explain to our clients why their data is going in the opposite direction of where we had them. This is not a good look for Moz. Rand Fishkin, one of the founders of Moz, was transparent about the issues <a href="http://moz.com/community/q/what-s-the-story-on-mozscape-updates">in a post when the issues we being reported at the end of April beginning of May</a>.</p>
<h2>Upset Clients</h2>
<p>With our SEO clients, depending on which plan you're on, you get a weekly or monthly SEO report. Our clients see the results of the faulty Mozscape and it really makes us look bad. That's any SEO organization using Moz's tools. We've looked into other tools to try and show better metrics, and we use Google Analytics to support our clients growth, but since Moz is the creator of Domain Authority it really makes it difficult. Thus far our clients understand what's going on because we have explained it to them in a way they can understand, but they were pretty upset when they received their auto generated report.</p>
<h2>We Believe in Rand!</h2>
<p>Rand Fishkin is one of my personal idols in the SEO world, and I know innovation has its road block and speed bumps. So I personally do not fault Moz on this error. As a web developer and a person who live his life in a pool of code I know finding a bug in a vast ocean of code can be one of the most challenging parts of being a developer or code engineer. I hope for their sake, they find the issue quick and get it resolved because many SEO companies like us rely on the data their tools output.</p>

	The Importance of a Responsive Web Design
          </a></h3><!-- Enf Blog Header -->

	
		<div class="blog-thumb"><a href="http://dev.versatechmarketing.com/blog/the-importance-of-a-responsive-web-design.html"><img src="http://dev.versatechmarketing.com/img/Logo-V-Blue.png" alt="VersaTech Marketing Blog" style="margin-left:-60px;"></a></div><!-- End Blog Thumb -->
	

        <div class="blog-content"><p>In todays technology driven world we find ourselves using our mobile devices rather than using our laptops or desktop computers. We're all driven by that convenience factor, power in the palms of our hands. This is now being reflected by the all powerful Google. Mobile web design, or responsive web design, is no longer just a design fad anymore, it's a necessity if you wish to rank in mobile search results.</p>
<h4>What's all the hype about?</h4>
<p>Around 2007, maybe a little bit longer, people started coming to the conclusion that mobile devices were going to shape the landscape of web design and development. We as an industry saw this around the time the original iPhones were starting come out and sweep the world. Internet and email at your finger tips. People were starting to use their phone as a way of finding local businesses on the go. Since then technologies and data speeds have increased so much, a lot of people are moving away from having home based internet and using their mobile devices as their primary source for their internet.</p>
<p>According to studies from <a href="http://www.nielsen.com" target="_blank">Nielsen</a>, <a href="http://www.marketingland.com" target="_blank">Marketing Land</a>, and our own independent study, 95% of mobile users use their devices for mobile search. 52% of all local searches are done from a mobile device. Finally 9 out of 10 mobile searches result in a purchase or visit. This is what all of the hype is about. 90% of mobile searches result in a purchase or visit, that's a high conversion rate.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940" src="/_img/Mobile-Search-Infographic.png" alt="Mobile Search Infographic" width="95%" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Okay, but I'm still not convinced I need a "Mobile-Friendly" website.</h4>
<p>You don't "<em><strong>NEED</strong></em>" a mobile-friendly website but here's more information to think about. Google has now started separating their mobile search results from their desktop search results. Meaning you could search for one thing at your house or office, get in your car and have a lapse of memory, search for the same thing on your phone and get completely different results.. These different results are due to these sites having a better user experience on mobile. As stated above 90% of mobile searches result in a purchase or visit. When people have a good first impression, a good first experience, they're more likely to make the first visit and become a repeat customer. So you don't need a mobile friendly site, but if you want to rank better for local results when people are shopping for your goods or services, then it would be in your best interest to have a mobile-friendly site.</p>
<h4>Ok, I'm swayed, but I've heard of responsive and a mobile site. What's the difference?</h4>
<p>There is a common notion that the two are one in the same. This is false and I want to clarify this right now so there are no misconceptions.</p>
<h4>Responsive Web Design</h4>
<p>Responsive web design is the are of web design where no matter what device, screen size, screen resolution, the site will always render a certain way. The look and feel will remain consistant because it's the same exact files being displayed, the content it just being shifted and moved to accomodate the size of the view port. If your site is not responsive, it's a good Idea to have it rebuilt to be responsive. It may cost more up front, but it will save you thousands in the long run. Did I mention that <a href="http://www.krymsonproductions.com/services/houston-web-design/" target="_blank">we build websites</a> with a mobile first mentality?</p>
<h4>Mobile Website</h4>
<p>A mobile website is usually a different set of code that is called by a piece of javascript based on the header output of the mobile browser. You commonly see mobile sites with a sub-domain of "m" (http://m.example.com). This commonly does not resize to fit any view port and can be a different experience from device to device. Content has to be duplicated from the main site and can cause duplicate content penalizations. Building a mobile website may seem more cost effective up front if you don;t want to rebuild your site. The problem with that is, because content is duplicated, any updates require double the work, so maintenance in the long run will cost you potentially thousands more.</p>
<h4>Let's recap what we've just went over.</h4>
<p>Responsive web design is the are of building a website for any viewport size and device. Mobile-friendly websites will rank higher in Google mobile search results. 90% of mobile searches end up with a purchase or visit. Choose responsive web design over a mobile web site, it will save you more money and you're going to have a consistant experience across all browsers and platforms.</p>

        <div class="blog-content"><p>In todays economy we see more and more people being frugal with their marketing efforts. There are many commercials on television right now advertising free website builders, One and One, Intuit, and Wix just to name a few. The common denominator between them all is that they all advertise to be free, easy to use and will help your businesses digital image. What they don’t tell you are the charges to use some features that are important to your business. Web Designers are professionals who already know and understand the needs of your business after the initial conversation. Web designers possess the ability to create the exact website to fit your needs and in the long run are cheaper, more reliable, and you have a direct point of contact for support and updates.</p>
<h3>
<p>Pros and Cons of Website Builders</h3>
<p>The one good thing about website builders is that funny little word “free”. What most people don’t realize that it’s free to a certain extent. Do you want social media integration? Extra monthly charge. Want an image gallery? Extra monthly charge. Want a capture form? Extra monthly charge. If all you’re doing is just trying to share some simple information then a website builder may be a great option for you otherwise over the course of a year you’ll probably end up spending the same amount that you would have if you would have had your site custom built for you. The biggest thing I try to tell my clients is with website builders if you want to move away from them you can’t take that website with you. You do not own that code nor do you own the design so if you move from them you have to start over from scratch. Starting over from scratch will cause your site to be down for days or even weeks until you finish everything. Another con to website builders is they’re often times not very search engine friendly. The key to many peoples businesses in getting new customers and traffic is people being able to search for your products or services. With poor code and slow load times many search engine might not index, or rank your website, well when someone types in one of your keywords.</p>
<h3>
<p>Pros and Cons of Web Designers</h3>
<p>As a web design company we hear “Why are custom website so expensive?” the truth is, web design is an art and we are a digital version of starving artist. All too many times people believe what we do is an easy craft, but it is quite the opposite. It’s very time consuming and if there’s a bug that has to be worked out it can take hours to find that bug. Next there’s the challenge of getting everything just right for the site owner that can also be very time extensive. The cost is more time than anything. So yes web designers are naturally going to be more expensive because you’re paying for their time rather than you spending countless hours on getting the web site builder just right and nickel and diming you in the process. One downfall over the years is some web designers, especially overseas designers, can be very unreliable and unreachable once the project is complete. It is highly encouraged to go with a reputable web designer who has a web design company, even if their an individual they need to be accountable as a business otherwise you could just be getting someone who needs a quick buck and won’t be there for you when you absolutely need them. When you have a web designer build your site, that code is legally yours to do what you like, unless otherwise noted in the contract (always read the contract and there should always be a contract). Meaning if you decided not to use that web designer anymore or they fell off the planet someone else can work on the website and it can be transferred from host to host.</p>
<h3>
<p>Which would you choose?</h3>
<p>Knowing this information which route would you choose for your business? If it’s strictly an informational website with no interactivity then a website builder may be the way to go otherwise your best option will always be a web designer to get the job done right and you own the digital property. Although at times some web designers can be unreliable but always look at their portfolio and give their clients a call to give you some feedback on their experience.</p>

	How Can SEO Help My Small Business Through This Economy?
          </a></h3><!-- Enf Blog Header -->

        <div class="blog-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-669" alt="Houston SEO Company" src="/_img/SEO.png" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p>SEO or Search Engine optimization is a great practice to reach new customers. With the way the economy is, people are opting to stay in and do research before spending money on gas to find a service or product. Many people for that fact opt to just shop online so they don’t have to face the crowds, use the local Google search and find a service provider in their local area. This is where SEO comes in to play and the reason why small businesses should make it part of their marketing strategy.</p>
<p>To start off there is tons of research involved in this process, and with most small business owners, there’s just not enough time to run and manage your business, and do research for your online presence. This is where a company that specializes in SEO is a good investment. The company will research the keywords that are best suited for you small business and industry. Following that content has to be revised one your website to correlate with your keywords and numerous HTML changes have to be fixed to best optimize your site. Finally after all of that is done, your website get submitted  to all of the major search engines. We here at Krymson Productions focus on the Big Three, Google, Bing, and Yahoo.</p>
<p>Now that your website is set up it has to be updated on a regular basis with genuine, new, relevant information that is informative for people to share and get new people to visit your site. These new visitors will stand a higher chance of becoming a conversion for you. This gives people more of a reason to come back to your site if you don’t sell products on your site.</p>
<p>The next step is promoting your small business locally. People don’t want to travel very far from the comfort of their home to get what they need; this is where local SEO makes its appearance. Have you ever Googled a service or a store and saw the map of where those locations are? You could be on that map and be within the proximity of the potential customer and make that conversion. One of the businesses we run SEO services for, <a title="Bits and Bytes Computers" href="http://www.bitsandbytes-computers.com/">Bits &amp; Bytes Computers</a>, 60% of their new business is from that local Google search, it’s a huge asset to them and it’s a vital tool for any small business.</p>
<p>Search Engine Optimization should never be your primary marketing tool for your website and small business, it’s a big part, but it should not be the primary tool. Telling your current customers about your site while giving them a business card with the site URL is an effective way of promoting your site and bringing in new clients as well.</p>
<p>The economy is not what it was 10 years ago, but neither is the internet and SEO is a powerfully marketing tool to aid your small business in this time of economic struggles.

        <div class="blog-content"><p>Krymson Productions is now offering SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Services and PPC (Pay Per Click) Services for all of our small business web design service clients. As a result of this expansion we are offering the SEO &amp; PPC services for $50 a month for the first 3 months and if you are satisfied with the results we will go from there.</p>
<h2>SEO Services</h2>
<p>SEO is the methods used to get your website ranking in the SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages) based on organic search results for related keywords to your site and/or industry... without paying for advertising. We do it the right way so you don't run the risk of getting banned and de-indexed from the SERPs.</p>
<p>Unlike our competitors we will not guarantee your website to be in the number one spot. We do this because it is simply impossible  to guarantee that spot with so much competition. Studies show that the majority of people skip the first few links on the page and usually click on the third and even fourth links before even looking at the first two. For this reason we believe that ranking between positions three and seven are the best positions to be in for conversions.</p>
<h2>PPC Services</h2>
<p>PPC is paid advertising. We specialize in <a title="Google AdWords" href="http://www.google.com/adwords">Google AdWords</a>. If you don't know what they are simply just Google something and look on the right side of the screen at the ads. This is a great way of attracting attention to your site for keywords you're not ranking very high on. You pay a certain amount per click that you can designate and our AdWords specialist will help work with you every step of the way.</p>
<p>AdWords is also a great tool to help when you have a new website and you’re site is not indexing just yet due to the Google sandbox effect. It’s a great way to start attracting traffic and help turbo boost your rankings to get your site indexing faster.</p>

	Taking your small business to the next level
          </a></h3><!-- Enf Blog Header -->

	
		<div class="blog-thumb"><a href="http://dev.versatechmarketing.com/blog/taking-your-small-business-to-the-next-level.html"><img src="http://dev.versatechmarketing.com/img/Logo-V-Blue.png" alt="VersaTech Marketing Blog" style="margin-left:-60px;"></a></div><!-- End Blog Thumb -->
	

        <div class="blog-content"><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-338" title="Next-Level-Business" src="/_img/Next-Level-Business.png" alt="" width="504" height="360" />Have you noticed that your small business has just been hanging in there, no decrease and no increase in sales just nice and steady? Your business has just, what the industry calls, reached a "plateau" point. The hardest part of going from plateau  to climbing up that proverbial money mountain. This post will give you a few ideas and some insight to get you business booming again. Yes, you've been busy, Yes you're tired, and yes you don't have any more time to take anything else on in your life to focus on growing your small business but I'm challenging you. This should be something you should do quarterly. Sit down and assess your business. Monitor your sales, see if you have hit that plateau yet and if you haven't, still read this article any to prevent hitting that plateau.</p>
<p>My first tip would be, take a look at your marketing plan. Are you advertising? Sure you are... The real question is are you advertising to the right people. Is your bar advertisement sitting in the lobby of a daycare center? Not really the best place for it, now how about on a college campus showing your DAILY specials with hundreds to thousand of college students who like to party and have fun? Which one is going to be the most profitable areas to advertise in? Are you using print ads, Google AdWords, Google +, Facebook, Twitter, etc...  How many of those people are on their that you personally know? Are they mainly friends and family?  Then you're advertising to the wrong people. You're wanting to get new people to your establishment. And again I'm going to use a bar for example... To get more people to follow your Facebook or Twitter page offer an incentive, a free well shot or draft beer when they sign up and follow, that $2 shot or beer will more than pay for itself when that customer comes in when you're announcing specials on Facebook and Twitter and spend $50+. My point is, yes you're advertising but are you getting out to the right people?</p>
<p>My second tip is get a web site, a GOOD website. Yes you can go out and get one of those cheep do it yourself web design schemes that allows you to build your own website but i can honestly  say that it's not going to look and function the way you want it to. So why not spend the little extra investment and have a web designer, someone like Krymson Productions, build you a website that fits you and not just a cookie cutter website that your company has to mold around. Then once your website is up and running MARKET IT! Introduce it to your followers on Facebook and Twitter, put it on all your print advertising, fliers and business cards.</p>
<p>My third tip and it's probably over looked a lot in most businesses, make sure you have the right staff. Try to find staff who are as passionate as you about your business. They are going to be the employees that will always deliver the best customer service and in turn bring in more repeat customers. Weed out the people who are there for just a paycheck. Take a deeper look about this in this article "<a title="Recognizing Potential" href="http://krymsonproductions.com/recognizing-potential/" target="_blank">Recognizing Potential</a>" right around the third paragraph. With the right staff you can have an enjoyable business with less stress and work with people with the same interests.</p>
<p>These are just a few tips on taking your small business to the next level. We are working on this here at Krymson Productions because we like to practice what we preach but these are proven methods in any business but easily overlooked by preoccupied business owners. Feel free to <a title="Contact" href="http://krymsonproductions.com/contact/" target="_blank">contact us</a> if these methods are helping your business.</p>

<p>Everyone is looking for potential. I say that in a broad term right now but I will break it down in to section a little later on. How can we define potential? The dictionary describes the word potential as "capable of being or becoming", and in the work place every business owner is looking for this in someone or something. I want to discuss this today in this article.</p>
<p>If you are a business owner then I know you have sat down and asked yourself "What is going to make my business run smoother?" or "Is there an easy way to manage financials without spending hundreds of laborious hours combing through receipts and mountains of data?". Then we turn to a little bit of research and find well to manage my expenses I can use Quicken® or Quickbooks® to help me manage all of my financials and payroll. Wow it also keeps track of all my spending and connects with my bank account to tell me what my business is spending money on, how much money I'm making, and it even makes life a easier when taxes come around. When you were doing your research you recognized the potential of one piece of software that will shave off HUNDREDS of man hours and may even reduce your expenses on a CPA and even tell you what you're spending too much money on.</p>
<p>When looking to hire new employees you are looking for potential. You ask yourself, "Is this person going to have the potential to grow with and help grow my business?". You will find this out in the interview you have with them. Now you know (or at least you should know) that people will B.S. you and lie to you to make themselves sound good to get the job. You have to focus your questions abut them so you get to know them... not their skills. If they have a degree in architecture you know they have the skills to design a building but are they passionate about it or are they doing it just because there is good money in it? So my first question that I ask new potential employees is, "When you wake up in the morning and you know you have to go to work, what is you first thought or reaction?" Listen to their answer, look at their facial expressions, look at the way they move their eyes, there is your actual answer. I know for my business here at Krymson Productions I want someone who wakes up in the morning bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and says "Hey, I'm living my dream, I get paid to express my creative ideas, have someone listen and give me recognition, and I get to help people in the process." Contrary to popular belief, money does not make a person happy, doing what you love everyday makes people happy. To wrap up this part of the topic, because I can go on all day about this, you have to look for those people who are going to have the potential to grow with and help grow your company. Someone you know that will be there 10 years down the line and you can trust that when you're not there, they are doing the right thing.</p>
<p>If you're a retailer you always on the lookout for that next product that's going to change your business. For example, you sell computer parts, you don't build computers just sell the parts. You have a good amount of customers but you always hear the question "Do you know someone who can fix computers? My motherboard went out and I'm not sure how to fix it." Sure you know how to instal a motherboard but why not charge $50 bucks and do it for that customer. You get that question 20 times a week, but you've been referring people to a bigger name company. It clicks, how much money have I been giving someone else for something that I can offer too. Now you recognize the potential in expanding your retail business into a service business as well. You hire a person or two to assist in computer repair work and in a bout a year you have potentially doubled your businesses revenues because not only are they buying the replacement parts from you but they are also paying for you to replace that part as well.</p>
<p>A big part of being a business owner is recognizing potential. I hope this article has opened your eyes to broaden your horizons and recognize the potential around you. Asking the right questions to people, asking yourself the right questions. This has helped me grow my businesses I hope it can help grow yours.</p>

	Waking Up Your Sleeping Website

<p>Is your website "sleeping", laying dormant, or just sitting there begging to be brought back to life? I'm not talking about a redesign or a make over or an overhaul, I'm talking about adding a human element to the site saying "I show love to my website, if you email me through my contact form I'm going to answer you not an automated replying program or service". Customers or clients prefer to see an active website rather than a "sleeping" website due to neglect.</p>
<p>There are multiple way's to wake up your sleeping beauty without killing yourself. You may be thinking by now, "well I'm active on my social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc...) so I don't have to worry about my website, I can have people follow me and like me on all the sites cause everyone uses them anyway." Don't take this the wrong way but your wrong. Sure people want to hear about what specials you're running but they also want to be able to know what your company does and what they can do, so they're going to need to visit your site. What if someone never went to your social media sites? What if they came straight from Google and saw that your last update to your site was January 1, 2000? They're going to click off your site because they know your company's website is going to be old news.</p>
<p>Here are my tips on how to awaken your site and bring it back to its fullest potential. First off if your site hasn't been updated since 2000, heck if it hasn't been updated since '09 you might want to consider a redesign using current industry standards. But I digress. Add a blog to your website, take a look at <a title="Why should small businesses blog?" href="http://krymsonproductions.com/why-should-small-businesses-blog/">this article</a> to see its advantages. If you want to be a little more creative, take a hint from search engine giant Google, do something different with your logo. Seamlessly integrate your Twitter feed (bottom right corner of this site for example) it also helps with search engine optimization. Insert a live chat feature on your site, and actually be available to answer questions even if it's only during regular business hours.Keep your website updated with the most current and most accurate information. Get creative, your website is your playground, the key is FIND A WAY TO CONVERT THOSE VISITORS IN TO NEW CLIENTELE.</p>
<p>These are my ways of waking up a website, I'm sure there are plenty more ways but these have worked wonders for me and I hope they work for you too.</p>

        <div class="blog-content"><p>As a web design contractor there are certain aspects of the job that can be extremely aggravating. Punctuality and design changes are the most common aggravations amongst designers and developers. These are the tips that I use to make the life of a contract  go as quick and smooth as possible.</p>
<p>We all have to deal with it because in our business it's inevitable to run across clients who are , well not exactly the most, punctual people on getting vital information to the web designer so the contract can be completed on time. Frustrating as it may be from our side you have to stop and think... Well are we dealing directly with the owner of the company that we're building the website for or are we simply dealing with a contact relaying the information to whom ever is in charge of development? Then you have to deal with how fast they can communicate with each other and then communicate back to you, the designer. You never know what they might be going through.</p>
<p>What I do before I even get a contract signed is I tell them upfront, they need to have all their information ready... similar sites they like for examples,content, images, pricing if any, contact information. Because if they are actually serious about having a website done these are the basics that they should have available from the start so when us as designers are finished with the design and coding all we have to do is plug in the information and it's done.</p>
<p>The next thing we find that most clients do it decide to change the design around numerous amounts of times which in turn drag out the project even longer and then it makes the web designer feel as though all their work is going to waste. Put in your contract somewhere a certain amount of times they can make major design changes because the best thing you can offer for them is you come up with 2-3 different mock ups and then have them pick one the they can change colors or small little layout pieces around.</p>
<p>It was short i know but this is my little tip guide on how to speed up a contract completion, reduce what I like to call "The Drag Effect".</p>

<p>For most small businesses the best way to keep your website relevant is to Blog. Search engines such as Google give websites more "brownie points" to those sites who update content often. The way Google is changing their search algorithms is specifically suited for "fresh" content.</p>
<p>If you're wanting to work to get to that top page on Google take 15-20 minutes out of your day to write a blog post about what's going on in your company or field of business, keep clients and customers (consumers) informed on your industry. Do you have a fresh new idea or new products or services that your company is adding? WRITE ABOUT IT! Tell people because not only do you have a better change of scoring that extra hit from Google and getting another client/customer, your current clients/customers may be interested in that new product or service and not only have you just increased your visibility on search engines but you have also increased your revenue and profits in one shot.</p>
<p>If you can't come up with a blog post a day then at least do 1 blog post a week. Us here at Krymson Productions are going to follow suit and follow our own advise and start doing at least one to three blog posts a week to give not only our clients but everyone on the internet fresh relevant news about not only the web design industry.</p>
<p>Blogging also lets your potential clients/customers know that you're active on your website, that if they email you through your contact form on your website they know that you're going to reply to that email and in turn create more business for your company.These are our main reasons for small businesses to have and maintain a blog. If you have any questions or want more tips please feel free to <a title="Contact" href="http://krymsonproductions.com/contact/">Contact Us</a>.</p>
